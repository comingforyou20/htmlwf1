            <h2 class="tit">Why the Persecution?</h2>
            <p class="p10">Throughout the 1990s, Falun Gong garnered support from numerous Chinese government agencies as a meditation practice deemed to improve public health and morality.</p>

            <p class="p10">But on July 22, 1999, a massive campaign of suppression was launched. What went wrong?</p>

            <video  controls poster="ae/i/vt2.jpg" src="ae/v/v2.mp4"></video>

            <p class="p10">One basic explanation for the seemingly irrational campaign against Falun Gong is the nature of China’s atheist and dictatorial Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which fears all groups outside its control – particularly ones that subscribe to a different ideology. From the mid-1990s, some in the Party felt their power threatened by Falun Gong’s popularity. The full persecution occurred following years of escalating harassment (timeline),</p>

            <p class="p10">The Party has tried several times to eradicate all expressions of religion from China (a country traditionally referred to as “the land of the divine”). To this day Roman Catholics, many Protestants, and Tibetan Buddhists cannot worship freely in China and are at constant risk of detention and torture.</p>

            <p class="p10">By 1999, Falun Gong became a natural target as it was the largest – and fastest growing – spiritual group in China with 100 million practitioners nationwide, according to Chinese government reports at the time.</p>

            <div class="infoi">

            </div>

            <p class="p10">Others have noted that the decision to launch the campaign is linked to former-Party head Jiang Zemin’s “fear” and “jealousy” of Falun Gong, while other leaders at the time found the group innocuous. Sources cited by the Washington Post state that, “Jiang Zemin alone decided that Falun Gong must be eliminated,” and “picked what he thought was an easy target.” (more about the origins of the campaign)

            <h2 class="tit">Torture</h2>
            <p class="p10">Perhaps the most prominent feature of the campaign has been its prevalent use of extreme torture. Torture of Falun Gong adherents has been documented in each of China’s provinces, in jails, labor camps, brainwashing centers, and schools in China’s big cities, small towns, and villages.</p>


            <div class="infoi">
                <img src="ae/i/i5.jpg">
                <span>Gao Rongrong, a Falun Gong practitioner from Liaoning province, was tortured in custody in 2005.</span>
            </div>
            

            <p class="p10">Common torture techniques include shocking with electric batons, burning with irons, tying the body in painful positions for days, force-feeding saline solutions through a plastic tube inserted up the nose, and prying out fingernails with bamboo shoots, to name a few; rape and sexual torture of the Falun Gong in detention are prevalent as well.</p>

            <p class="p10">To date over 4,000 deaths have been documented, and at least 63,000 accounts of torture. An estimate of the real figure puts the actual death toll in the tens of thousands.</p>

        <section id="s6">

            <h2 class="tit">Imprisonment and Brainwashing</h2>
            <p class="p10">
                For hundreds of thousands of people in China, the most basic reality of the campaign against Falun Gong has been long periods of detention in “reform through labor” camps or prisons – China’s Gulag system – after farcical or nonexistent trials. There they are forced to work up to 20 hours per day, producing – without pay – toys, Christmas tree lights, chopsticks, and soccer balls for export. Those who refuse are tortured.
            </p>
            <p class="p10">
                Be it in labor camps, jails, or in special reeducation centers, all detained Falun Gong practitioners have been forced to undergo what can only be described as brainwashing. The Communist Party’s goal is to force these people to renounce their spiritual beliefs and come to view Falun Gong as dangerous, as well as to turn in others who are active in exposing the persecution.
            </p>
            <div class="infoi">
                <img src="ae/i/i6.jpg">

            </div>

            <p class="p10">The key ingredients of the brainwashing process, or what the Party calls “transformation,” is sleep deprivation, hours on end of staring at videos vilifying Falun Gong, threats, and Cultural Revolution-style “struggle sessions”. Some particularly “stubborn” individuals who refuse to transform are injected with psychotropic drugs in asylums as treatment for the mental disorder of incorrect political thinking.

        Organ Harvesting
    </h2>
    <video  controls poster="ae/i/vt3.jpg" src="ae/v/v3.mp4"></video>
    <p class="p10">
    The Party’s ultimate solution for the vast number of incarcerated Falun Gong adherents, however, is much more terrifying. According to current and former hospital employees, the Falun Gong have been used in reverse organ-matching – they have been killed by the thousands so that their organs can be used for on-demand transplants.</p>
<p class="p10">
Livers, kidneys, hearts, and cornea are removed from the living, anesthetized Falun Gong adherents with matching blood-types and sold to Party officials and other desperate-yet-wealthy individuals from China and abroad. Undercover investigators’ phone calls to Chinese hospitals have caught doctors boasting about this practice on tape.</p>
